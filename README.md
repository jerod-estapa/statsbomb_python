# statsbomb_python
Python Package for using Statsbomb IQ dataset

This is a work in progress package to allow Python users to work with Statsbomb IQ's free public datasets. The code so far looks only at a match by match json.

## TO DO SHORT TERM ##
- pull goal keeper data from json
- write code for pass maps
- write code for player level data (shots,tackles,interceptions etc..)
- create player location shot maps (using SB's freeze frame, plot where players, GK etc.. are when shot is taken)
- add expanded event information to dataframe

## TO DO LONG TERM ##
- combine matches to look at player/team data over longer time period
